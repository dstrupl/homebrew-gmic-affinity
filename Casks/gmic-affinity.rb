  # The plugin shells out to the gmic CLI. The `gmic` formula provides
  # exactly that binary plus the runtime libs (cimg, fftw, libtiff,
  # libpng, openexr, libomp). It does not ship a Qt GUI, but we don't
  # need one — the picker dialog is our own native Cocoa code.
  #
  # G'MIC-Qt (the standalone GUI / GIMP plugin from gmic.eu) is NOT a
  # Homebrew formula or cask and is intentionally not depended on. It
  # is unrelated to this plugin; users who want it can grab it from
  # https://gmic.eu/download.html separately.

  # Current Homebrew rejects redundant minimum macOS versions under
  # Homebrew/OSDependsOn. The bundle's LSMinimumSystemVersion remains the
  # authoritative macOS 11 runtime floor.

  # Homebrew manages the Photo 2 copy as the bundle artifact. A structured
  # postflight step makes the independent v3 copy: declaring the same source
  # twice works on a fresh install but collides while Homebrew backs up the
  # predecessor cask during an upgrade.
