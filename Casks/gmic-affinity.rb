  # The plugin shells out to the gmic CLI. The `gmic` formula provides
  # exactly that binary plus the runtime libs (cimg, fftw, libtiff,
  # libpng, openexr, libomp). It does not ship a Qt GUI, but we don't
  # need one — the picker dialog is our own native Cocoa code.
  #
  # G'MIC-Qt (the standalone GUI / GIMP plugin from gmic.eu) is NOT a
  # Homebrew formula or cask and is intentionally not depended on. It
  # is unrelated to this plugin; users who want it can grab it from
  # https://gmic.eu/download.html separately.

  # `:big_sur` (bare symbol) is the modern lower-bound form. brew
  # style rejects the older `">= :big_sur"` string-comparator shape
  # under Homebrew/OSDependsOn — the bare symbol means "this macOS or
  # later", which is what we want.

  # Install one source bundle into both Affinity plugin folders. If
  # `brew audit --cask` rejects two `artifact` stanzas pointing at the
  # same source path, fall back to a single `artifact` plus a
  # `preflight` block doing the second copy with FileUtils.cp_r — see
  # release design doc §5.2 risk #3.
